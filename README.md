## Transit Project
This project is just me messing around with transit data. I'm also trying to learn a bit about using APIs and API keys.

I thought I'd make it easier to know when the next train South is arriving so I know how much time I have before I need to go. I might add it to an Alexa skill.

### Setup
You need to set the api key, so for now run the project with `ONEBUSAWAY_API_KEY='<your-key>' python3 transit_request.py`
