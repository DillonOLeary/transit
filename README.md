## Transit Project
I wanted to make it easier to know when the next train South is arriving so I know how much time I have before I need to go. In the end I want this project to be built on with AWS and be an Alexa skill.

### Setup
You need to set the api key, so for now run the project with `ONEBUSAWAY_API_KEY='<your-key>' python3 transit_request.py`
